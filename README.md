# Advanced React Component Patterns

This contains the projects used for the course [Advanced React Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns).

The author describes the course:

    The goal of this course is to give you the knowledge of advanced patterns you can use to make React
    components that are more flexible, simpler, and more fun to build, use, and maintain. You'll start
    with a simple <Toggle /> component which you'll progressively refactor to each of the patterns so
    you can see the relative trade-offs of the patterns and how they can be used together to increase
    the usefulness of your component while at the same time simplifying things for everyone.
